title: Setting a manual date range doesn't display correctly
desc: |-
  I was playing with using a specific date range, which worked, but was somewhat clunky
  having to select a new range each week.  I noticed that the end date on this feature
  is incorrectly displayed at the top of the screen.  No matter what date I have set, it
  always displays one day later, but the data is correct.
