title: Empty cell instead of "00:00" in report makes it more readable
desc: |-
  It's hard to get a overview of the report on the device when there is a lot of days with "00:00". Perhaps it would be better to just leave the field empty then?
  
  This might have some implications for the application processing the CSV-file if the user exports it. But most spreadsheet applications will probably threat an empty cell as 0 anyway.
