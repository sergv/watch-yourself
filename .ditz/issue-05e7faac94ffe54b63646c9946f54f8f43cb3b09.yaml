title: Display newest task times first
desc: |-
  When you have logged a lot of days and you want to adjust the latest time, as I often have to do when I forgot to stop the timer, you would have to scroll all the way to the bottom.
  
  It would be better if the list were sorted in the other order so the latest times (or at least days?) are in the beginning of the list.
