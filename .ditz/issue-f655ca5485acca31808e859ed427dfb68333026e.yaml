title: Time Entries Self-Delete
desc: |+
  Changing the date of a time entry causes it to become deleted.
  Changing the time of an entry seems to cause its deletion after some delay.
  
  Reproduction: (date change)
  Start and stop a timing even for a project.
  Use "show times" then "Edit time"
  change the month day number
  press ok, then back
  any time added by the entry will not be displayed in the project total
  using "show times" again reveals that the time entry is missing.
  
  Reproduction: (time change)
  create a time entry as above, (but change only the time)
  Later, after exiting and reentering the app, and through a process that is unclear, the entry will become deleted at some later time. (perhaps as the local time changes through midnight? I will experiment more and post here if I find a better way of reproducing it. It does not happen immediately.)
  
  
  os version 1.5 cupcake is in use on a g1 for all of this.
