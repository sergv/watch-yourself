title: Ordering of tasks changes/incorrect on Task Start/Stop
desc: |-
  5 tasks added to list - in either portrait or landscape mode selecting a task to start it re-orders the list - selecting the "ticked" task to stop it seems to select the wrong task, and so stops the original task but starts another one automatically.
  
  Sorry if the description doesn't make as much sense - will try and get it loaded onto the Android Emulator to get screenshots!
