title: Allow task grouping
desc: |-
  Add the ability to group tasks.
  The parent task should not be triggerable
  The parent task should sum the times of the child tasks
  Tasks should be groupable after they've been made
  The task view should preserve the depth of the task board
  Assign a "default" task for the parent task, so that triggering the parent task starts the child
  Grouped tasks should be ungroupable
  The report should allow selecting the depth of the view
