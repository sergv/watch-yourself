    If a single timing event overlaps two days, the full time will show up on the
    day the task _starts_ in the task and time list views.  This is not true for
    the report view, where the times are correctly split into the correct days.
    
    I'm not yet sure whether I want to change this behavior.  It makes some sense
    to change it for the task list, but it makes less sense to fix it in the time
    list view; what is being viewed there are full time range events, start to end,
    and I don't want to artificially break them up.  However, the time list is a
    reflection of what's shown in the task list, and it is reasonable to keep them
    in sync.
