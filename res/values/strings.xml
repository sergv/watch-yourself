    <string name="purpose">TimeTracker helps you record the amount of time you spend on
        activities; for example, for recording time in a time sheet at work.  It
        provides ways to view, edit, and filter times, and provides a 
        time sheet report as well.</string>
    <string name="usage">
    Detailed instructions are at http://trac.germane-software.com/TimeTracker\n\n
    • Create some tasks using the menu\n
    • Tap a task to start timing; tap it again to stop timing\n
    • Use the task context menu to list times for the task\n
    • Change the displayed time range with the menu\n
    • View a weekly report with the menu\n
    \n
    Tapping a different task switches timing to the other task.  Two tasks can 
    not be running at the same time.\n
    \n
    The task context menu allows you to edit tasks (change their names), delete tasks
    (including all of the time history for that task!), or view the time log for that
    task.\n
    \n
    <b>Time Log view</b>\n
    \n
    The time log for a task is filtered on the same range that you selected for the
    main task view, so if you filtered the task view for <i>This Week</i> and you open
    the time log, then you'll only see times for this week.  Use the <i>Add Time</i> 
    menu item to manually insert times into the time log.  Use the context menu
    for a time to delete or edit a time range.\n
    \n
    <b>Note</b> that TimeTracker will not prevent you from creating times that overlap
    with times in other (or the same) task.
