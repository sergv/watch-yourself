    <string name="purpose">TimeTracker helps you record the amount of time you spend on
    activities, for example, for recording time in a time sheet at work.  It provides
    ways to view, edit, and filter times, as well as providing a time sheet report.</string>
    <string name="usage">Create some tasks using the main task view's <i>Add Task</i> menu item.
    Tap a task to start timing; tap it again to stop timing, or tap a different task
    to switch timing to the other task.  Two tasks can not be running at the same time.
    Use the <i>Change View</i> menu item to filter the time display by a date range, such as
    viewing times for <i>Today</i>, <i>Yesterday</i>, <i>This Week</i>, etc.
    Use the <i>Report</i> menu item to view a report of the daily time sums per task
    for an entire week.
    
    The task context menu allows you to edit tasks (change their names), delete tasks
    (including all of the time history for that task!), or view the time log for that
    task.
    
    The time log for a task is filtered on the same range that you selected for the
    main task view, so if you filtered the task view for <i>This Week</i> and you open
    the time log, then you'll only see times for this week.  Use the <i>Add Time</i> to
    manually insert times into the time log.  <b>Note</b> that TimeTracker will not
    prevent you from creating times that overlap with times in other (or the same) task.
    Use the context menu for a time to edit the time range, or simply click
    on a time to do the same thing.  The context dialog for a time also includes
    the option of deleting the time.
